# Coded Correspondence

[Coded Correspondence](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/bi-data-analyst/tracks/dsf-python-fundamentals-for-data-science-part-ii/modules/dsf-python-strings/projects/coded-correspondence-project)

### Project Goals
You and your pen pal, Vishal, have been exchanging letters for some time now. Recently, he has become interested in cryptography and the two of you have started sending encoded messages within your letters.
In this project, you will use your Python skills to decipher the messages you receive and to encode your own responses! Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles.

### Directions
Open the file *"coded_correspondence.ipynb"* for a walkthrough of the project.
